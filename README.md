# Real-time video analytics

The goal of this repo is to build a real-time
video analytics system that is capable of solving
multiple various tasks.

## Features:

- \[x\] Identify number of unique customers in the shop
- \[x\] Track each customer
- \[ \] Identify how many people entered and exited shop during the video
- \[ \] Identify gender (male/female) and age (child/adult as classification) for each customer
- \[ \] Identify number of unique customers that made a purchase
- \[ \] Identify if cashier is right or left-handed

## Usage

### Installation

1. Install [ poetry ](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) and use system env (in case using conda or other):

```
poetry env use system
```

2. Install torch and torchvision with conda (or other):

```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

3. Install dependencies (poetry is recommended but requirements.txt is also available):

```
poetry install
```

4. Install ffmpeg as per system.

### Tools and packages

[Fiftyone](https://docs.voxel51.com/index.html) is used as the main tool for managing data
and labels. [Fire](https://google.github.io/python-fire/guide/) is the main cli entrypoint
to run all scripts. User inputs are validated with
[pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/).

The `FiftyoneDataset` class is the main entrypoint to run all commands.
Check out its usage below:

```
NAME
    main.py FiftyoneDataset - Usage docs: https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.7/concepts/models/

SYNOPSIS
    main.py FiftyoneDataset GROUP | COMMAND | <flags>

FLAGS
    -n, --name=NAME (required)
        Type: str
    -o, --overwrite=OVERWRITE
        Type: bool
        Default: False

```

### Run the commands

1. Create a fiftyone dataset to visualize data and labels:

```
pymn FiftyoneDataset --name <name> create <path/to/video/folder>

# keep fiftyone running to observe changes
fiftyone app launch <name>
```

2. Run detection and tracking with YOLOv8 and Boxmot:

```
pymn FiftyoneDataset --name <name> track --model yolov8s --label-field yolov8s
```

This command will create a label field "yolov8s" that will contain
detections with COCO classes and track ids.

3. Count and track customers

To be able to identify a customer we need to annotate
a cashier's zone in a yaml config file. Once a fiftyone
dataset is created, find out video sample id from web UI
and add an entry to the [ config file ](configs/annotations.yaml)
following the existing example.

3.1. Add these annotations to fiftyone:

```
pymn FiftyoneDataset --name <name> annotate_zones configs/annotations.yaml --label_field zone
```

Verify the correctness of zone annotations in the fiftyone app.

3.2. After adding zones, run the following command to label
each person as a cashier or a customer:

```
‚ùØ pymn FiftyoneDataset --name <name> identify_customer --tracking_field yolov8s --zone_field zone --iou-threshold 0.5

Output:
6665610ec7102da65e0f95ef cashier counts: 2
6665610ec7102da65e0f95ef customer counts: 41
```

A new label field is created that maps a "person" class to either "cashier" or
"customer" based on the intersection with the "cashier" zone.
